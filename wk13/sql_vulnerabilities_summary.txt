1 - This works as expected.

Since the input is a regular string, the SQL executes normally and returns: No active users found with that first name. Because the user was not active.

2 - This does NOT works as expected.
the SQL executes and returns the user info, even-though the active status is 0;

 3 - This also does NOT works as expected.
 the site returns 134.122.47.53 took too long to respond.
 
 FOR GETUSERS_2.PHP
 
 1,2,3 - ALL queries worked. They all return: No active users found with that first name.
