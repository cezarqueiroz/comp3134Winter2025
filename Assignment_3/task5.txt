Content of the two comments:
   - Comment 1: I have a severe dairy allergy and I got the matcha with oat milk but it tasted like it contained dairy and I complained and the owner argued with me for a bit then told my there is condensed milk in the their premixed matcha. Im not sure why i wasn't told there is dairy in the the matcha when i chose a non dairy substitute. And the owner argued with me about it for a bit because when I tried the matcha once before I did not taste any dairy but she said it always has had condensed milk in it. I think it was made with real milk because even a little bit of condensed milk would not have the strong milk flavour I tasted. I only had 1 sip and I immediately knew. She also refused to remake it because she did not want to waste it and just gave me a refund. it was a bad experience for me and it could have been dangerous if I had consumed the full drink.
   - Comment 2: It was really busy during lunch time on a weekday. Service was good and quick though. I got the shrimp ravioli and portions were huge. I had leftovers for dinner. The truffle fries and hummus dip were both really good and great for sharing.
