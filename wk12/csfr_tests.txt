CSRF Test Observations:

Test 1 - Using csfr_form.php:
- Form submission worked as expected.
- If username and password were correct, login success message appeared.
- The session token matched the hidden form token â€” CSRF validation passed.

Test 2 - Using csfr.html:
- Even though the username and password were correct, the request was blocked.
- CSRF validation failed because the submitted token didn't match the session token.
- This confirms the CSRF protection mechanism is working.

Mitigation Success
