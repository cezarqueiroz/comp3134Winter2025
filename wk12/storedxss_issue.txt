Stored XSS Issue:

The file 'storexss.php' reads and displays the content of 'storedxss.txt' directly to the web page without sanitizing or escaping it.

This is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Since the script tag in 'storedxss.txt' executes when a user visits the page, an attacker could:
- Steal cookies or session tokens.
- Redirect users to malicious pages.
- Perform actions on behalf of logged-in users.

This vulnerability is especially dangerous because:
- It is persistent (stored), affecting every user who views the page.
- It can execute malicious scripts silently without user input.
